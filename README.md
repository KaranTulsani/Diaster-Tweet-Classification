# 🌍 Disaster Tweet Classification  

This project focuses on **classifying tweets as disaster-related or not** using **Machine Learning models**.  
We experimented with **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier** to evaluate their effectiveness in text classification tasks.

## 📌 Project Overview  
In times of crisis, social media becomes a key communication channel. However, not all tweets mentioning "fires", "earthquakes", or "floods" are real disaster reports.  
This project aims to automatically classify whether a tweet refers to a **real disaster** or is **unrelated/misleading**.

## ⚙️ Models Used  
- **Logistic Regression** → Baseline model, good for linear separation.  
- **Random Forest Classifier** → Ensemble model, handles non-linearities and complex patterns.

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset is derived from the **Disaster Tweets dataset (Kaggle)**:    
- `target` → `1` if disaster-related, `0` otherwise
